# lmpy

The lmpy package implements some basic linear regression techniques, and complements existing Python implementations. It contains basic linear regression tools, including heteroskedasticity robust and clustered standard errors, as well as basic bootstrapping tools, including the wild bootstrap and the cluster robust bootstrap by [Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/rest.90.3.414). This project is in its very early stages and documentation is virtually nonexistent, so use it at your own risk.
